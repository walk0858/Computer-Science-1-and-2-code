chapter i.
i go to styles


the intense interest aroused in the public by what was known at the
time as “the styles case” has now somewhat subsided. nevertheless, in
view of the world-wide notoriety which attended it, i have been asked,
both by my friend poirot and the family themselves, to write an account
of the whole story. this, we trust, will effectually silence the
sensational rumours which still persist.

i will therefore briefly set down the circumstances which led to my
being connected with the affair.

i had been invalided home from the front; and, after spending some
months in a rather depressing convalescent home, was given a month’s
sick leave. having no near relations or friends, i was trying to make
up my mind what to do, when i ran across john cavendish. i had seen
very little of him for some years. indeed, i had never known him
particularly well. he was a good fifteen years my senior, for one
thing, though he hardly looked his forty-five years. as a boy, though,
i had often stayed at styles, his mother’s place in essex.

we had a good yarn about old times, and it ended in his inviting me
down to styles to spend my leave there.

“the mater will be delighted to see you again—after all those years,”
he added.

“your mother keeps well?” i asked.

“oh, yes. i suppose you know that she has married again?”

i am afraid i showed my surprise rather plainly. mrs. cavendish, who
had married john’s father when he was a widower with two sons, had been
a handsome woman of middle-age as i remembered her. she certainly could
not be a day less than seventy now. i recalled her as an energetic,
autocratic personality, somewhat inclined to charitable and social
notoriety, with a fondness for opening bazaars and playing the lady
bountiful. she was a most generous woman, and possessed a considerable
fortune of her own.

their country-place, styles court, had been purchased by mr. cavendish
early in their married life. he had been completely under his wife’s
ascendancy, so much so that, on dying, he left the place to her for her
lifetime, as well as the larger part of his income; an arrangement that
was distinctly unfair to his two sons. their step-mother, however, had
always been most generous to them; indeed, they were so young at the
time of their father’s remarriage that they always thought of her as
their own mother.

lawrence, the younger, had been a delicate youth. he had qualified as a
doctor but early relinquished the profession of medicine, and lived at
home while pursuing literary ambitions; though his verses never had any
marked success.

john practised for some time as a barrister, but had finally settled
down to the more congenial life of a country squire. he had married two
years ago, and had taken his wife to live at styles, though i
entertained a shrewd suspicion that he would have preferred his mother
to increase his allowance, which would have enabled him to have a home
of his own. mrs. cavendish, however, was a lady who liked to make her
own plans, and expected other people to fall in with them, and in this
case she certainly had the whip hand, namely: the purse strings.

john noticed my surprise at the news of his mother’s remarriage and
smiled rather ruefully.

“rotten little bounder too!” he said savagely. “i can tell you,
hastings, it’s making life jolly difficult for us. as for evie—you
remember evie?”

“no.”

“oh, i suppose she was after your time. she’s the mater’s factotum,
companion, jack of all trades! a great sport—old evie! not precisely
young and beautiful, but as game as they make them.”

“you were going to say——?”

“oh, this fellow! he turned up from nowhere, on the pretext of being a
second cousin or something of evie’s, though she didn’t seem
particularly keen to acknowledge the relationship. the fellow is an
absolute outsider, anyone can see that. he’s got a great black beard,
and wears patent leather boots in all weathers! but the mater cottoned
to him at once, took him on as secretary—you know how she’s always
running a hundred societies?”

i nodded.

“well, of course the war has turned the hundreds into thousands. no
doubt the fellow was very useful to her. but you could have knocked us
all down with a feather when, three months ago, she suddenly announced
that she and alfred were engaged! the fellow must be at least twenty
years younger than she is! it’s simply bare-faced fortune hunting; but
there you are—she is her own mistress, and she’s married him.”

“it must be a difficult situation for you all.”

“difficult! it’s damnable!”

thus it came about that, three days later, i descended from the train
at styles st. mary, an absurd little station, with no apparent reason
for existence, perched up in the midst of green fields and country
lanes. john cavendish was waiting on the platform, and piloted me out
to the car.

[7m--More--(10%)[27mthe intense interest aroused in the public by what was known at the
[7m--More--(10%)[27mtime as “the styles case” has now somewhat subsided. nevertheless, in
[7m--More--(10%)[27mview of the world-wide notoriety which attended it, i have been asked,
[7m--More--(10%)[27mboth by my friend poirot and the family themselves, to write an account
[7m--More--(10%)[27mof the whole story. this, we trust, will effectually silence the
[7m--More--(10%)[27msensational rumours which still persist.
[7m--More--(10%)[27m[K
[7m--More--(10%)[27mi will therefore briefly set down the circumstances which led to my
[7m--More--(11%)[27mbeing connected with the affair.
[7m--More--(11%)[27m[K
[7m--More--(11%)[27mi had been invalided home from the front; and, after spending some
[7m--More--(11%)[27mmonths in a rather depressing convalescent home, was given a month’s
[7m--More--(11%)[27msick leave. having no near relations or friends, i was trying to make
[7m--More--(11%)[27mup my mind what to do, when i ran across john cavendish. i had seen
[7m--More--(11%)[27mvery little of him for some years. indeed, i had never known him
[7m--More--(11%)[27mparticularly well. he was a good fifteen years my senior, for one
[7m--More--(11%)[27mthing, though he hardly looked his forty-five years. as a boy, though,
[7m--More--(11%)[27mi had often stayed at styles, his mother’s place in essex.
[7m--More--(11%)[27m[K
[7m--More--(11%)[27mwe had a good yarn about old times, and it ended in his inviting me
[7m--More--(11%)[27mdown to styles to spend my leave there.
[7m--More--(11%)[27m[K
[7m--More--(11%)[27m“the mater will be delighted to see you again—after all those years,”
[7m--More--(11%)[27mhe added.[K
[7m--More--(11%)[27m[K
[7m--More--(11%)[27m“your mother keeps well?” i asked.
[7m--More--(11%)[27m[K
[7m--More--(11%)[27m“oh, yes. i suppose you know that she has married again?”
[7m--More--(11%)[27m[K
[7m--More--(11%)[27mi am afraid i showed my surprise rather plainly. mrs. cavendish, who
[7m--More--(11%)[27mhad married john’s father when he was a widower with two sons, had been
[7m--More--(11%)[27ma handsome woman of middle-age as i remembered her. she certainly could
[7m--More--(11%)[27mnot be a day less than seventy now. i recalled her as an energetic,
[7m--More--(11%)[27mautocratic personality, somewhat inclined to charitable and social
[7m--More--(12%)[27mnotoriety, with a fondness for opening bazaars and playing the lady
[7m--More--(12%)[27mbountiful. she was a most generous woman, and possessed a considerable
[7m--More--(12%)[27mfortune of her own.
[7m--More--(12%)[27m[K
[7m--More--(12%)[27mtheir country-place, styles court, had been purchased by mr. cavendish
[7m--More--(12%)[27mearly in their married life. he had been completely under his wife’s
[7m--More--(12%)[27mascendancy, so much so that, on dying, he left the place to her for her
[7m--More--(12%)[27mlifetime, as well as the larger part of his income; an arrangement that
[7m--More--(12%)[27mwas distinctly unfair to his two sons. their step-mother, however, had
[7m--More--(12%)[27malways been most generous to them; indeed, they were so young at the
[7m--More--(12%)[27mtime of their father’s remarriage that they always thought of her as
[7m--More--(12%)[27mtheir own mother.
[7m--More--(12%)[27m[K
[7m--More--(12%)[27mlawrence, the younger, had been a delicate youth. he had qualified as a
[7m--More--(12%)[27mdoctor but early relinquished the profession of medicine, and lived at
[7m--More--(12%)[27mhome while pursuing literary ambitions; though his verses never had any
[7m--More--(12%)[27mmarked success.
[7m--More--(12%)[27m[K
[7m--More--(12%)[27mjohn practised for some time as a barrister, but had finally settled
[7m--More--(12%)[27mdown to the more congenial life of a country squire. he had married two
[7m--More--(12%)[27myears ago, and had taken his wife to live at styles, though i
[7m--More--(12%)[27mentertained a shrewd suspicion that he would have preferred his mother
[7m--More--(13%)[27mto increase his allowance, which would have enabled him to have a home
[7m--More--(13%)[27mof his own. mrs. cavendish, however, was a lady who liked to make her
[7m--More--(13%)[27mown plans, and expected other people to fall in with them, and in this
[7m--More--(13%)[27mcase she certainly had the whip hand, namely: the purse strings.
[7m--More--(13%)[27m[K
[7m--More--(13%)[27mjohn noticed my surprise at the news of his mother’s remarriage and
[7m--More--(13%)[27msmiled rather ruefully.
[7m--More--(13%)[27m[K
[7m--More--(13%)[27m“rotten little bounder too!” he said savagely. “i can tell you,
[7m--More--(13%)[27mhastings, it’s making life jolly difficult for us. as for evie—you
[7m--More--(13%)[27mremember evie?”
[7m--More--(13%)[27m[K
[7m--More--(13%)[27m“no.”[K
[7m--More--(13%)[27m[K
[7m--More--(13%)[27m“oh, i suppose she was after your time. she’s the mater’s factotum,
[7m--More--(13%)[27mcompanion, jack of all trades! a great sport—old evie! not precisely
[7m--More--(13%)[27myoung and beautiful, but as game as they make them.”
[7m--More--(13%)[27m[K
[7m--More--(13%)[27m“you were going to say——?”
[7m--More--(13%)[27m[K
[7m--More--(13%)[27m“oh, this fellow! he turned up from nowhere, on the pretext of being a
[7m--More--(13%)[27msecond cousin or something of evie’s, though she didn’t seem
[7m--More--(13%)[27mparticularly keen to acknowledge the relationship. the fellow is an
[7m--More--(13%)[27mabsolute outsider, anyone can see that. he’s got a great black beard,
[7m--More--(13%)[27mand wears patent leather boots in all weathers! but the mater cottoned
[7m--More--(13%)[27mto him at once, took him on as secretary—you know how she’s always
[7m--More--(13%)[27mrunning a hundred societies?”
[7m--More--(14%)[27m[K
[7m--More--(14%)[27mi nodded.[K
[7m--More--(14%)[27m[K
[7m--More--(14%)[27m“well, of course the war has turned the hundreds into thousands. no
[7m--More--(14%)[27mdoubt the fellow was very useful to her. but you could have knocked us
[7m--More--(14%)[27mall down with a feather when, three months ago, she suddenly announced
[7m--More--(14%)[27mthat she and alfred were engaged! the fellow must be at least twenty
[7m--More--(14%)[27myears younger than she is! it’s simply bare-faced fortune hunting; but
[7m--More--(14%)[27mthere you are—she is her own mistress, and she’s married him.”
[7m--More--(14%)[27m[K
[7m--More--(14%)[27m“it must be a difficult situation for you all.”
[7m--More--(14%)[27m[K
[7m--More--(14%)[27m“difficult! it’s damnable!”
[7m--More--(14%)[27m[K
[7m--More--(14%)[27mthus it came about that, three days later, i descended from the train
[7m--More--(14%)[27mat styles st. mary, an absurd little station, with no apparent reason
[7m--More--(14%)[27mfor existence, perched up in the midst of green fields and country
[7m--More--(14%)[27mlanes. john cavendish was waiting on the platform, and piloted me out

[7m--More--(10%)[27mthe intense interest aroused in the public by what was known at the
[7m--More--(10%)[27mtime as “the styles case” has now somewhat subsided. nevertheless, in
[7m--More--(10%)[27mview of the world-wide notoriety which attended it, i have been asked,
[7m--More--(10%)[27mboth by my friend poirot and the family themselves, to write an account
[7m--More--(10%)[27mof the whole story. this, we trust, will effectually silence the
[7m--More--(10%)[27msensational rumours which still persist.
[7m--More--(10%)[27m[K
[7m--More--(10%)[27mi will therefore briefly set down the circumstances which led to my
[7m--More--(11%)[27mbeing connected with the affair.
[7m--More--(11%)[27m[K
[7m--More--(11%)[27mi had been invalided home from the front; and, after spending some
[7m--More--(11%)[27mmonths in a rather depressing convalescent home, was given a month’s
[7m--More--(11%)[27msick leave. having no near relations or friends, i was trying to make
[7m--More--(11%)[27mup my mind what to do, when i ran across john cavendish. i had seen
[7m--More--(11%)[27mvery little of him for some years. indeed, i had never known him
[7m--More--(11%)[27mparticularly well. he was a good fifteen years my senior, for one
[7m--More--(11%)[27mthing, though he hardly looked his forty-five years. as a boy, though,
[7m--More--(11%)[27mi had often stayed at styles, his mother’s place in essex.
[7m--More--(11%)[27m[K
[7m--More--(11%)[27mwe had a good yarn about old times, and it ended in his inviting me
[7m--More--(11%)[27mdown to styles to spend my leave there.
[7m--More--(11%)[27m[K
[7m--More--(11%)[27m“the mater will be delighted to see you again—after all those years,”
[7m--More--(11%)[27mhe added.[K
[7m--More--(11%)[27m[K
[7m--More--(11%)[27m“your mother keeps well?” i asked.
[7m--More--(11%)[27m[K
[7m--More--(11%)[27m“oh, yes. i suppose you know that she has married again?”
[7m--More--(11%)[27m[K
[7m--More--(11%)[27mi am afraid i showed my surprise rather plainly. mrs. cavendish, who
[7m--More--(11%)[27mhad married john’s father when he was a widower with two sons, had been
[7m--More--(11%)[27ma handsome woman of middle-age as i remembered her. she certainly could
[7m--More--(11%)[27mnot be a day less than seventy now. i recalled her as an energetic,
[7m--More--(11%)[27mautocratic personality, somewhat inclined to charitable and social
[7m--More--(12%)[27mnotoriety, with a fondness for opening bazaars and playing the lady
[7m--More--(12%)[27mbountiful. she was a most generous woman, and possessed a considerable
[7m--More--(12%)[27mfortune of her own.
[7m--More--(12%)[27m[K
[7m--More--(12%)[27mtheir country-place, styles court, had been purchased by mr. cavendish
[7m--More--(12%)[27mearly in their married life. he had been completely under his wife’s
[7m--More--(12%)[27mascendancy, so much so that, on dying, he left the place to her for her
[7m--More--(12%)[27mlifetime, as well as the larger part of his income; an arrangement that
[7m--More--(12%)[27mwas distinctly unfair to his two sons. their step-mother, however, had
[7m--More--(12%)[27malways been most generous to them; indeed, they were so young at the
[7m--More--(12%)[27mtime of their father’s remarriage that they always thought of her as
[7m--More--(12%)[27mtheir own mother.
[7m--More--(12%)[27m[K
[7m--More--(12%)[27mlawrence, the younger, had been a delicate youth. he had qualified as a
[7m--More--(12%)[27mdoctor but early relinquished the profession of medicine, and lived at
[7m--More--(12%)[27mhome while pursuing literary ambitions; though his verses never had any
[7m--More--(12%)[27mmarked success.
[7m--More--(12%)[27m[K
[7m--More--(12%)[27mjohn practised for some time as a barrister, but had finally settled
[7m--More--(12%)[27mdown to the more congenial life of a country squire. he had married two
